# MindMate – An AI-powered Early Mental Health Assistant  

Final project for the **Building AI course**  

## Summary  

MindMate is an AI assistant that helps people track their mental health through daily mood check-ins, journaling, and personalized well-being recommendations. It doesn’t replace therapy but encourages early awareness and self-care.

## Background  

Mental health challenges such as stress, anxiety, and depression are widespread but often go unnoticed until they become severe.  

* 1 in 8 people worldwide live with a mental health condition (WHO).  
* Many avoid seeking help due to stigma or lack of awareness.  
* I’ve personally seen friends and colleagues experience burnout without realizing they needed support.  

**Why this matters:**  
Mental health is harder to detect than physical illness. Early awareness tools could empower individuals to notice changes before things worsen.

## How is it used?  

* Users log daily moods and short journal entries via an app or website.  
* The AI analyzes mood trends and provides supportive feedback.  
* If prolonged low moods are detected, the app gently nudges users to seek help.
